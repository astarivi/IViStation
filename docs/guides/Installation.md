# IVistation Installation

Here's what to keep in mind when installing IVistation, and what you may need to do so. Keep in mind this guide will not
go into much depth, as anyone interested in using IVistation is likely familiar with modding already.

### Warning

**If you use IVistation as your main dashboard, make sure you know how to recover if it fails. For this reason, it is
recommended to have your console always reachable by your computer through FTP, and to have a backup dashboard to load 
to. An UnleashX DVD, Rocky5 Extras Disc, or dual booting are all excellent backup choices.**

## Prerequisites
- ### An OG Xbox console
    It must be modded and has to be capable of running homebrew. It is recommended to upgrade the console
    mod to a recent one, like [Rocky 5 Xbox Softmodding Tool](https://github.com/Rocky5/Xbox-Softmodding-Tool) for
    softmodded consoles, and recent BIOS images, like Cerbios, for hardmodded systems. Additionally, the console
    must be connected to the internet, or to your device of choice, and reachable via FTP.
- ### Any kind of device with an FTP client
    Although anything with an FTP client may work, a computer is recommended. Use what you have.

## Installation

[Download IVistation]() and decompress the lone folder contained within the .zip you have just downloaded. 
This `IVistation` folder is what you will transfer to the console, so go ahead and do so with your FTP
client of choice. Note that some FTP clients let you choose the transfer type, I recommend using "Binary" transfer mode.

The destination folder will be wherever your current dashboard searches for Applications, and where you have enough 
storage space. That's usually `E:` for those with stock hard drives, or `F:` for those with modded hard drives, in a 
folder called `Apps` or `Applications`.

If you want to use IVistation as your main dashboard, you should already know what to do. If you do not, please refrain
from doing so. Either way, read the **"Warning"** section.

**Never transfer IVistation to your `C:` partition.**
